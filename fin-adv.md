### 1. **Start Small: Pick One Change at a Time**
Instead of overhauling your spending overnight, focus on one area at a time. For example, in the first month, you might focus on tracking your expenses. In the next, you could work on reducing eating out or limiting spontaneous trips.

#### Action Plan:
- **Month 1**: Start by tracking all your expenses daily for one month. Use an app or even just a notebook.
- **Month 2**: Focus on reducing eating out. Set a limit for yourself (e.g., 2 meals out per week).
- **Month 3**: Reduce drinking expenditures, such as having drinks at home with friends instead of bars, or limiting the number of nights out.
  
This gradual approach will keep it manageable and less overwhelming.

### 2. **Automate Your Savings Early**
As soon as your income increases to 102k rubles, set up an automatic transfer from your checking account to a savings account every month. Start with an amount that doesn’t feel like a huge burden, such as 5-10% of your income. Over time, you can increase it to 20-30%.

#### Action Plan:
- Set up an automatic transfer of **10,000 rubles** as soon as your salary increases. Don’t wait to “feel ready,” just automate it. After a few months, you won’t even miss that money.

### 3. **Set Weekly or Monthly Challenges**
Gamify the process. Set small, achievable challenges that will help you adjust your habits. For example:
- A **“No-Spend Week”** where you only spend on essentials.
- A **“Home-Cooked Week”** where you prepare all meals at home.
  
These small challenges will create momentum and give you confidence.

#### Action Plan:
- Start with a **No-Spend Weekend** once a month, or choose one weekend where you spend nothing on entertainment or dining.
  
### 4. **Reward Yourself for Progress**
Saving doesn’t mean you have to give up everything you enjoy. Build rewards into your plan when you hit small savings milestones. For example:
- If you manage to save **30,000 rubles** over 3 months, reward yourself with a nice meal out or a short trip.
  
This helps you stay motivated without feeling deprived.

#### Action Plan:
- Decide on small rewards that feel satisfying but don’t break the bank (like a dinner or a day trip).

### 5. **Use a Visual Tracker**
A visual goal tracker can help keep you motivated. Whether it’s a savings thermometer or a progress bar in an app, seeing your savings grow can reinforce your efforts.

#### Action Plan:
- Create a simple savings tracker (either digital or physical) where you can see your progress toward your Italy trip fund. Set a realistic goal and track how much you save monthly.

### 6. **Use the "50/30/20 Rule" as a Guide**
This popular budgeting rule can be a great starting framework. Here's how to break it down:
- **50%** for needs (rent, groceries, bills)
- **30%** for wants (dining, drinks, travel)
- **20%** for savings and debt repayment
  
This allows you to enjoy life while also saving.

#### Action Plan:
- In your next budget, allocate your new salary according to this rule. Adjust as needed, but keep savings and needs as priorities.

### 7. **Reflect on the Big Picture**
Whenever you’re tempted to spend on things that don’t align with your goals, remind yourself of the bigger picture. Thinking about your long-term desires—like that trip to Italy—can make it easier to resist smaller temptations.

#### Action Plan:
- Keep a note or reminder (in your wallet or phone) about your long-term goals, so that every time you think about spending impulsively, you’re reminded of the bigger reward.
